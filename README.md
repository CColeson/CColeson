Was working on a rougelike, soulslike, COD-Zombies clone called _Shallow Be Thy Grave_, but have left that on the backburner as I continue schoolwork and work work. Am (most likely) going to participate in [the 9th GBJam](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-9) with a friend, so keep your eyes peeled for a submission from me.

Might learn Rust in the future idk.
